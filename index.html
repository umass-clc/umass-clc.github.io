	<p>A group of coffee enthusiasts who order beans in bulk from the local microroastery, Share.</p>
	<p>Ordering in bulk gives members ~50% discount over MSRP.</p>
	<p>Orders happen every-other week; a member picks up the order from the roastery.</p>
	<p>Coffees change monthly, a representative example is:</p>

	<p><b>FULL DETAILS:</b></p>

	<p>1. Every other week, we will solicit orders from the club via email.  To preserve the sanity of the person placing the order, orders will be due on Sunday night no later than 6pm.  Orders will be placed the next day. </p>

	<p>2. You will need to pay for your coffee at the time that you place your order.  Again, to preserve the sanity of the person placing the order, we are going to mandate that you use Square Cash (https://cash.me/), which in our opinion is a fairly low-barrier and safe payment option. </p>

	<p>3. Every other week, on Tuesday or Wednesday, a different club member will be responsible for picking up the order from Share Coffee Roasters in Hadley.  NOTE: we strongly encourage all members of the club with transportation to take turns picking the order up from the roastery. </p>

	<p>4. After the club member assigned for pickup has retrieved the coffee, they will be responsible for notifying the club that the coffee is available on campus for pickup, where, and when.  For example, I might say "Hey everyone.  The coffee is here.  You can come pick it up today or tomorrow from 10am to 6pm in CS354.  My cube is the fourth on the right."</p>

	<p>5. Share's coffee selection and prices may vary from week to week.  We will send out the current offerings each week with prices.  Share offers coffee in bags that come in three sizes: a) 6 oz (3/8 pound) b) 12 oz (3/4 pound) and c) 48 oz (3 pound).  Orders are at bag-level granularity.</p>

	<p>6. We will do our best to get you what you ordered, but availability of beans is sometimes limited.  To avoid confusion, we ask that if you are not OK with letting Share choose substitutions for you, that you please note the desired substitution or specify "no substitutions" in your order.
